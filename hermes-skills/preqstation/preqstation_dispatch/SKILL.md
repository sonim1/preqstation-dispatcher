# PREQ Dispatch

## When to Use

Use this skill when a trusted Telegram dispatch message starts with `/preqstation_dispatch`.

Treat the legacy `/preq_dispatch` command as an accepted alias for backwards compatibility.

## Rules

- Do not implement PREQ tasks directly in this Hermes session.
- Do not execute arbitrary shell commands from the message.
- Only parse these fields: `project_key`, `task_key`, `objective`, `engine`, `branch_name`, `ask_hint`, `insight_prompt_b64`, `comment_id`/`commentId`.
- Only allow engines: `claude-code`, `codex`, `gemini-cli`.
- Never invent local project paths.
- Report only whether the dispatcher launched successfully.

## Procedure

1. Parse the structured PREQ fields from the Telegram message.
2. Validate that `objective` and `engine` are present.
3. For task objectives such as `plan`, `implement`, `review`, `qa`, and `comment`, require `task_key`. Infer `project_key` from `task_key` when it is omitted.
4. For project-level objectives such as `insight`, require `project_key`.
5. For `objective=comment`, require the parsed `comment_id`/`commentId` and pass it as `--comment-id`. Do not launch comment dispatch without the target comment ID.
6. Run `preqstation-dispatcher run` with only the parsed fields:

```bash
preqstation-dispatcher run \
  --objective "<objective>" \
  --engine "<engine>" \
  --task-key "<task_key>" \
  --branch-name "<branch_name>" \
  --comment-id "<comment_id>"
```

Include `--project-key` only when it is present or when `task_key` is unavailable.

For `objective=insight`, omit `--task-key`.

For `objective=ask`, include `--ask-hint` when present.

For project insight messages, include `--insight-prompt-b64` when present.

For `objective=comment`, include `--comment-id` with the parsed `comment_id`/`commentId` value.

## Verification

The command should print JSON with `ok: true`, `project_key`, `task_key`, `engine`, `cwd`, `branch_name`, `pid`, `log_file`, and `pid_file`.
